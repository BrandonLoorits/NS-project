#Abstract

Airline route planning is a complex task, involv-
ing numerous factors. Using the principles of
graph theory, we explored a method to predict
future airline routes. Our approach involved
constructing a weighted graph from a dataset
of historical flight data, performing network
analysis to determine central nodes (airports),
and predicting possible new routes based on
centrality measures. The proposed model effec-
tively predicted potential airline routes, open-
ing the way for more robust and sophisticated
predictive modeling in airline planning       

This project is created for NS course assignment.

Quick Start Guide:
1. Open the notebook in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
2. Upload the data files to the environment (e.g., in Colab) or keep them in the same folder as the notebook file.
3. Click 'Run all' to execute all the code chunks.
