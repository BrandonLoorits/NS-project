#Abstract

Airline route planning is a complex task, involv-
ing numerous factors. Using the principles of
graph theory, we explored a method to predict
future airline routes. Our approach involved
constructing a weighted graph from a dataset
of historical flight data, performing network
analysis to determine central nodes (airports),
and predicting possible new routes based on
centrality measures. The proposed model effec-
tively predicted potential airline routes, open-
ing the way for more robust and sophisticated
predictive modeling in airline planning
